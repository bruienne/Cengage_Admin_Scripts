This tool creates Munki-ready printer pkg installers and their pkginfo files by querying a Windows 2003/2008 print server.

Requirements:

* Munkitools - https://code.google.com/p/munki/downloads/detail?name=munkitools-0.8.4.1770.0.dmg
* The Luggage - https://github.com/unixorn/luggage

To successfully use this tool the user must provide the following CLI options (in the below order):

* A version string for their printer installer(s) (e.g. 1.0, 2.5, etc.)
* A catalog the printer installer pkg(s) will belong to. This can be a new catalog or an existing one.
* A Windows print server name, either hostname or FQDN (e.g. sampleps01, sampleps01.company.com)
* A privileged username, short username or UPN (e.g. jdoe or jdoe@domain.com)
* The privileged user's password
* Optionally a regex string may be supplied to filter certain print queues, e.g. *HP*, *Xerox*, *8100*


Examples:

Connect to myprintserver.company.com as user "printuser" using a password and create installer pkg(s) for HP printers only. Mark the created printer installer pkg(s) as version "1.0" and add them to the "printers" catalog.

./create_munki_managed_printers 1.0 printers myprintserver.company.com printuser pr1nt4fun *HP*

Connect to myprintserver as user "guest" without a password and create installer pkg(s) for all available printers. Mark the created printer installer pkg(s) as version "1.2" and add them to the "printers" catalog.

./create_munki_managed_printers 1.2 printers myprintserver guest ""


Caveats:

This is a pretty ugly shell script, but it works for my purposes. The option parsing is inflexible and should probably be retooled. I welcome anyone to take a stab at that, I simply haven't had the time.
